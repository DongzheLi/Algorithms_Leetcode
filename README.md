# CS61b Data Structure & Leetcode Solutions & Crack the Coding Interview book

I started on 2019/12/10, forgot to track progress until today, 2019/12/27. I basically finished the Crack the Coding Interview book, Top75 questions from Leetcode and implemented all data structures showed in CS61b such as TreeMap, HashMap, 2-3 Tree, Red-Black Tree, Disjoint Unions, Heaps, Priority Queues, Tries, K-D tree, and many other tree and graph traversal algorithms.
