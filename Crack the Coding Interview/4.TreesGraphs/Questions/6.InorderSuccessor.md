# Inorder Successor

## Inorder Traversal

[Leetcode inorder traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/solution/)

Write an algorithm to find the "next" node (i.e. in-order successor) of a given node in a binary search tree. You many assume that each node has a link to its parent.

[Leetcode question](https://leetcode.com/problems/inorder-successor-in-bst/)

Left most child to its right.

## Solution 1: Inorder Traversal

In order Successor:

1. if the node has a right child, the most left child in its right subtree.
2. otherwise, the successor is somewhere upper in the tree.

We could just do Inorder Traversal, but scenario 1 is faster, so we implement it.

```java
public TreeNode inorderSuccessor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p) {

    // Scenario 2: the successor is somwhere higher in the tree.
    ArrayDeque<TreeNode> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
    int inorder = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

    // In order traversal: left, node, right
    while (!stack.isEmpty() || root != null) {
        // 1. Travel as left as you can
        while (root != null) {
            stack.push(root);
            root = root.left;
        }
        // 2. Logic around the node
        root = stack.pop();
        // if the previous node equals to p, the current node is the successor
        if (inorder == p.val) return root;
        inorder = root.val;

        // 3. go one step right
        root = root.right;
    }
    return null;
}
```
