# Question 9: String Rotation

Suppose you have a method `isSubstring` checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring

Key Observation:

```
if a word is a rotation of another, it is rotated around a particular point.

waterbottle -- rotate at the third character--> erbottlewat

and if you put two rotations together, you are bound to have a substring = the original word.

erbottlewat+erbottlewat = erbottle(waterbottle)wat
```

## Solution 1: concat two rotations together gives a copy of the original

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isRotation(String s, String t) {
        if (s.length() != t.length() || s.length() = 0) return false;

        return s.isSubstring(t+t);
    }
}
```
