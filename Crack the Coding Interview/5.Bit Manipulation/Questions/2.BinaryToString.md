# Binary to String

Given a real number between 0 and 1 (e.g. 0.72) that is passed in as a double.

print its binary representation.

If the number cannot be represented accurately in binary with at most 32 characters, print "error".

Example:

 What does a non-integer number in binary looks like?

 0.101 in binary = 1 * 1/2 + 0 * 1/4 + 1 * 1/8.

 How to shift this?

 2(base 10) * 0.101 = 1.01(binary)

## Solution 1:

```java
String printBinary(double num) {
    if (num >= 1 || num <= 0) return "ERROR";

    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    sb.append(".");

    while (num > 0) {
        /* Limit of length is 32. */
        if (sb.length() >= 32) return "ERROR";

        double r = num * 2;
        if (r >= 1) {
            sb.append(1);
            num = r - 1;
        } 
        else {
            sb.append(0);
            num = r;
        }
    }
    return sb.toString();
 }
```
