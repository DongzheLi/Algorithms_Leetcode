# Pairwise Swap

Write a program to swap odd and even bits in an integer with as few instructions as possible.

swap bit 0 and bit 1. swap bit 2 and bit 3.

---

## Solution 1:

```java
/**
* Mask all odd bits with 10101010 in binary
* (which is 0xAA), then shift them right by * 1, put them in even spots.
* Mask all even bits with 01010101 in binary
* (which is 0x55), then shift them left by 
* 1, put them in odd spots.
* Then merge these two.
*/
public int swapOddEvenBits(int x) {
    return (((x & 0xaaaaaaaa) >>> 1) | ((x & 0x55555555) << 1));
}
