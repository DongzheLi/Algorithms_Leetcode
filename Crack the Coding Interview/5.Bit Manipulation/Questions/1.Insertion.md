# Insertion

Given two 32-bit numbers, M and N, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. 

if M = 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.

Example:

```
Input: N = 10000000000, M = 10011, i = 2, j = 6
Output: N = 10001001100
```

## Solution 1:

```java
public int updateBits(int n, int m, int i, int j) {
    /* Create a mask that has 0 from i to j. if i = 2, j = 4. a 8-bit mask = 11100011. */
    int allOnes = ~0;   // 11111111
    // left = 11100000
    int left = allOnes << (j + 1);  // shift left, put j+1 0s to the end.
    // right = 00000100 - 1 = 00000011 
    int right = ((1 << i)) - 1);    // shift left by 2, then minus 1.
    // mask = 11100011
    int mask = left | right;

    /* Clear bits i to j in n */
    int clearedN = n & mask;
    /* Shift m into position. */
    int shiftedM = m << i;

    /* Put shiftedM in position in N. */
    return clearedN | shiftedM;
}
```
