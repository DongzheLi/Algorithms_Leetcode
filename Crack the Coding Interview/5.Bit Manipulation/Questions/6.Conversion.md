# Conversion

Write a function to determine the number of bits you would need to flip to convert integer A to integer B.

---

Example:

Input: 29(11101),  15(01111)

Output: 2

Solution:

Basically We want to see how many differences we can find.

Exclusive OR, XOR: returns 1 only when its 1 xor 0, 0 xor 1.

```java
public int countFlips(int a, int b) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int c = a ^ b; c != 0; c = c >> 1) {
        count += (c & 1);
    }
    return count;
}
```

c = c & (c - 1) will clear the least significant bit in c.

```java
public int countFlips(int a, int b) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int c = a ^ b; c != 0; c = c & (c-1)) {
        count++;
    }
    return count;
}
```
