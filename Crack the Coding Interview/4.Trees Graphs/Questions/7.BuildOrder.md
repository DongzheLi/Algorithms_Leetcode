# Build order:

You are given a list of projects and a list of dependencies.

This really is the same as scheduling, it is topological ordering.


```java
/** Build a adjacency list graph from list of edges. */
Graph buildGraph(String[] projects, String[][] dependencies) {
    Graph graph = new Graph();

    for (String project : projects) {
        graph.createNode(project);  // each project is a vertex
    }

    for (String[] dependency : dependencies) {
        String first = dependency[0];
        String second = dependency[1];
        graph.addEdge(first, second);
    }
    return graph
}

/** Find a correct build order. */
Project[] findBuildOrder(String[] projects, String[][] dependencies) {
    Graph graph = buildGraph(projects, dependencies);

    return orderProjects(graph.getNodes());
}

/** Return a list of the projects a correct build order. */
Project[] orderProjects(ArrayList<Project> projects) {
    Project[] order = new Project[projects.size()]; // result array of projects

    /** Add "roots" to the build order first. */
    int endOfList = addNonDependent(order, projects, 0);

    int toBeProcessed = 0;
    while (toBeProcessed < order.length) {
        Project current = order[toBeProcessed];
        /** A circular dependency occurs */
        if (current == null) return null;
        // Remove my self as dependency
        ArrayList<Project> children = current.getChildren();
        for (Project child : children) {
            child.decrementDependencies();
        }
        // add children that has no one depending on them.
        endOfList = addNonDependent(order, children, endOfList);
    }
    return order;
}
```
