# Technical Questions

## A list of absolutely must know knowledge:

Need to know each implementation and its runtime and space.

| Data Structures       |      Algorithms      |              Concepts |
| --------------------- | :------------------: | --------------------: |
| Linked Lists          | Breadth-First Search |      Bit manipulation |

## Work Through a problem

+ Listen: write down necessary information.
+ Example: Write a big enough non-special-case example.
+ Brute force: State a naive algorithm and its runtime, don't code yet.
+ Optimize: Walk through brute force with BUD optimization:

    + Buttolenecks
    + Unnessary work
    + Duplicated Work
    + Time vs space tradeoff: consider a Hash table
    + Unused info
    + Solve it manully on a example

+ Walk Through: Walk through your approach in detail. Make sure you understand each detail before you start coding.
+ Implement: Modularize your code from the beginning and refactor to clean up anything that isn't beautiful.
+ Test: 

    + Conceptual test: Walk through your code again.
    + Look for unusual or non-standard code.
    + Hot spots, like arithmetic and null nodes.
    + Small test cases.
    + Special and edge cases.
