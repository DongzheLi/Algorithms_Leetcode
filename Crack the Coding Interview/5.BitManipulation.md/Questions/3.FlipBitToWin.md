# Flip Bit to Win

You have an integer and you can flip exactly one bit from 0 to 1.

Write code to find the length of the longest sequence of 1s you could create.

---

Example:

```
1775 = 11011101111
flip bit 4;
       11011111111
Output = 8
```

---

Solution:

Every integer is a sequence(array) of 0s and 1s. We want to find single 0, ...101...

Walk throught the integer.

Track the current 1sequence length and previous 1sequence length.

When we see a 0:

+ if the next bit is 0, then we can't merge these two, set previousLength to 0.
+ if the next bit is 1, previousLength = currentLength,

Update maxLength as we travel and see a longer one.

```java
public int flipBit(int a) {
    /* if all 1's, it is already the longest. */
    if (~a == 0) return Integer.BYTES * 8;

    int previousLength = 0;
    int currentLength = 0;
    int maxLength = 1;           // we can at least flip one 0.

    while (a != 0) {
        if ((a & 1) == 1) {      // current bit is a 1.
            currentLength++;
        }
        else if ((a & 1) == 0){  // current bit is a 0
            // Update previousLength to 0 if next bit is 0, to currentLength if next bit is 1
            previousLength = (a & 2) == 0 ? 0 : currentLength;
            currentLength = 0;
        }  
        maxLength = Math.max(previousLength + currentLength + 1, maxLength);
        a >>>= 1;   // logical right shift.
        // logical right shift >>>
        // 10110110->01011011->00101101->00010110
        // ->00001011->00000101->00000010->00000001->0
    }
    return maxLength;
}
```
