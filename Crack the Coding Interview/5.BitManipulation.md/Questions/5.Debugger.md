What the following code do?

```
((n & (n - 1)) == 0)
```

1. What does A & B == 0 mean?

    It means A and B never have 1 at the same bit.

    if n & (n - 1) == 0 : n and n-1 never shares a 1 at the same bit.

2. What does n-1 do?

    ```
    1101011000 [base 2]
    -        1
    ----------
    1101010111
    ```

    So, starts from the left, it flips 0 to 1, until we see the first 1, change 1 to 0.

    i.e. if n = abcde1000, n-1 = abcde0111

3. What does n & (n-1) == 0 mean now???

    abcde must be all 0s.

    n = 000001000, so n is a power of 2, or 0.
