# Question 4: Partition

Partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x.

If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements less than x. The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition", it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.

```
3, 5, 8, 5, 10, 2, 1   partition=5

5 doesn't have to be in the middle

3, 1, 2, 10, 5, 5, 8
```

My thoughts:

Do this brute force. Keep a lower Linkedlist, keep a higher linkedlist, then later on, concat the higher one to the lower one.

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode partition(ListNode node, int x) {
        ListNode beforeStart = null;
        ListNode afterStart = null;

        ListNode beoforeEnd = null;
        ListNode afterEnd = null;

        /** Partition list */
        while (node != null) {
            ListNode next = node.next;
            node.next = null;
        }
    }
}
```

## Solution 2:

```java
public class QuestionC {

	public static LinkedListNode partition(LinkedListNode node, int x) {
		LinkedListNode head = node;
		LinkedListNode tail = node;

		/* Partition list */
		while (node != null) {
			LinkedListNode next = node.next;
			if (node.data < x) {
				/* Insert node at head. */
				node.next = head;
				head = node;
			} else {
				/* Insert node at tail. */
				tail.next = node;
				tail = node;
			}
			node = next;
		}
		tail.next = null;

		return head;
	}
}
```
