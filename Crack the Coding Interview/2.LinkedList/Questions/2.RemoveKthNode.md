# Question 2: Return kth node from the last

Implements an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.

Example:

```
1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
After removing the second node from the end.
1->2->3->5
```

My Thoughts: The hard part is to know the length of the list, once we know that, we can tranverse again to return that node.

But the hard part is how to do this in one run.

Second runner.

```

1->2->3->4->5->6->7->null, and k = 2

we have first pointer at head 1,
second pointer at head.next.next 3,

when second pointer == null,
we have found our kth from the last element
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int kthFromLast(ListNode head, int k) {
        ListNode p1 = head;
        ListNode p2 = head;

        /** Move p1 k steps into the list. */
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (p1 == null) return null;    // out of bounds
            p1 = p1.next;
        }
        /** Move p1, p2 at the same time.
            when p1 is at the end, p2 is at our desired element */
        while (p1 != null) {
            p1 = p1.next;
            p2 = p2.next;
        }
        return p2;
    }
}
```
