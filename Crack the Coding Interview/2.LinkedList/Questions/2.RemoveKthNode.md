# Question 2: Return kth node from the last

Implements an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.

Example:

```
1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
After removing the second node from the end.
1->2->3->5
```
## Solution 1: Two pointers

```java
class Solution {
    public int kthFromLast(ListNode head, int k) {
        ListNode p1 = head;
        ListNode p2 = head;

        /** Move p1 k steps into the list. */
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (p1 == null) return null;    // out of bounds
            p1 = p1.next;
        }
        /** Move p1, p2 at the same time.
            when p1 is at the end, p2 is at our desired element */
        while (p1 != null) {
            p1 = p1.next;
            p2 = p2.next;
        }
        return p2;
    }
}
```
