## Question 7 : Intersection :::: Very cool Observation

Given two singly linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect. Return the intersecting node.

The intersection is defined based on reference, not value.

That is, if the kth node of the first linked list is the exact same node (by reference) as the jth node of the second linked list, then they are intersecting.

## Solution 1: Two Pointers

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode s1, ListNode s2) {
        if (s1 == null || s2 == null) return null;

        ListNode p = s1;
        ListNode q = s2;
        // if s1 and s2 have different length, then we will stop the loop after second iteration.
        while (p != q) {
            // once reach the end of first iteration,
            // set the pointer to the head of another linkedlist.
            p = (p != null) ? p.next : s2;
            q = (q != null) ? q.next : s1;
        }
        return p;
    }
}
```
