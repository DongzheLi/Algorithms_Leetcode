# Stack of Plates

Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks .push() and SetOfStacks .pop() should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop( ) should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).


## Solution 1:

```java
public class SetOfStacks {
    List<Stack> stacks = new ArrayList<>();
    public int capacity;
    public SetOfStacks(int capacity) {
        
    }
    public void push(int v){
        Stack last = getLastStack();
        if (last != null && !last.isFull()) {
            last.add(v);
        } else {    // create a new stack
            Stack stack = new Stack(capacity);
            stack.push(v);
            stacks.add(stack);
        }   
    }
    public int pop(){
        Stack last = getLastStack();
        if (last == null) throw new EmptyStackException();
        int v = last.pop();
        if (last.size == 0) stacks.remove(stacks.size() - 1);
        return v;
    }
}
```
