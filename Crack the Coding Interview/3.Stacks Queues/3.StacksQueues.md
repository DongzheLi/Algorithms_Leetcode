# Stacks and Queues

0. [stack](img/stack.png) and [queue](img/Queue.png)

1. [Three in One](Questions/1.ThreeInOne.md) : Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks
2. [Stack Min](Questions/2.StackMin.md) : Design a stack that supports min(), which returns the minimum element of the stack. should operate in O(1) time.
3. [Stack of Plates](Questions/3.StackofPlates.md) : Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks .push() and SetOfStacks .pop() should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop( ) should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
4. [Queue Via Stacks](Questions/4.QueueTwoStacks.md): Implement a queue with two stacks
5. [Sort Stack](Questions/6.SortStack.md): Sort a stack so the smallest items are on the top.

## Question 5: Sort Stack

Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top. You can use an additional temporary stack, but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure(such as an array).
