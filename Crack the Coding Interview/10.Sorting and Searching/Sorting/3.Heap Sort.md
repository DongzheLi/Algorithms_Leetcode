# HeapSort: 
   
Use a Max-oriented Heap

Unlike selection sort, instead of rescanning entire array looking for minimum, maintain a heap so that getting the minimum is fast.

For reasons that will become clear soon, we will use a max-oriented heap.

Heap: [demo](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VEd2Pm_3OuvkC1M8T5XAhsBTQFxVHs386L79hktkDRg/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.g11ecaeaf56_0_0)

## Naive HeapSort: 

+ Insert all items into a max heap, and discard input array. Create output array.
+ Repeat N times:

    + Delete largest item from the max heap.
    + Put largest item at the end of the unused part of the output array.
    
Runtime: O(NlogN), Space: extra array for output

# In-place Heapsort 

Alternate approach, treat input array as a heap. [demo](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SzcQC48OB9agStD0dFRgccU-tyjD6m3esrSC-GLxmNc/edit#slide=id.g463de7561_042)

+ Use a process known as "bottom-up heapification" to convert the array into a heap.

    + bottom-up heapify: sink nodes in reverse level order

    + Avoids need for extra copy of all data.
    + Once heapified, algorithm is almost the same as naive heap sort.

Use Heap to sort our data:

+ Bottom-up heapification: O(NlogN), N sink operations, each taking no more than O(logN) time. space: in-place, no extra space.
+ Selecting largest item: Theta(1) time.
+ Removing largest time: O(logN) for each removal.


```java
public class HeapSort {
    public void sort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;

        // Build heap (rerange array in place)
        for (int i = n/2 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            heapify(arr, n, i);
        }
        // Iteratve over heap
        for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            // swap current root to end
            int temp = arr[0];
            arr[0] = arr[i];
            arr[i] = temp;
            // call max heapify on the reduced map
            heapify(arr, 0, i);
        }
    }

    // Heapify a subtree rooted with node i, which is an index in arr[], n is size of heap
    private static void heapify(int[] arr, int i, int n) {
        /* sink down arr[i] */
        int largest = i;    // Initialize largest as root
        int left = 2*i + 1; // left child 
        int right = 2*i + 2;// right child

        // if left child is larger than root
        if (left < n && arr[left] > arr[largest])
            largest = left;
        // if right child is larger than largest so far
        if (right < n && arr[right] > arr[largest])
            largest = right;
        // if largest is not root
        if (largest != i) {
            // swap root with largest
            int temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[largest];
            arr[largest] = temp;

            // recursively heapify the affected sub-tree
            heapify(arr, n, largest);
        }
    }
}
