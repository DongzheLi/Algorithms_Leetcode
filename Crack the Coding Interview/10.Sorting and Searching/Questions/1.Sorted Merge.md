# Merge two sorted arrays

Given two sorted arrays, A and B, where A has a large enough buffer at the end to hold B. Write a method to merge B into A in sorted order.

My Thoughts:

It seems easy, but it is not. because once you put an element into A, you need to shift all the elements to the right by 1.

Key idea: Not if we merge from the back of A and B, compare the last element of A and last element of B,
put the larger one to the back of A.

```
Let us work on an example.
a = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, , , , , ]
b = [2, 4, 6, 8]
Step 1: insert b to the back of a
a = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6 , 8]
```
```java
public void merge(int[] a, int[] b, int lastA, int lastB) {
    int indexA = lastA - 1; // index of last element in array a.
    int indexB = lastB - 1; // index of last element in array b.
    int indexMerged = lastA + lastB - 1; // end of merged array.

    /* Merge a and b, start from the last element in each */
    while (indexB >= 0) {   // only need to move all elements in B, since elements in A are already sorted.
        if (indexA >= 0 && a[indexA] > b[indexB]) {
            a[indexMerged] = a[indexA];
            indexA--;
        } else {
            a[indexMerged] = b[indexB];
            indexB--;
        }
        indexMerged--;
    }
}
```
