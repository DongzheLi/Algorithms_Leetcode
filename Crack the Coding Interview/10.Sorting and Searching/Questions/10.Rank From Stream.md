# Rank from Stream

Imagine you are reading in a stream of integers. Periodically, you wish to be able to look up the rank of a number x(the number of values less than or equal to x).

Implement the data structures and algorithms to support these operations.

track(int x): called when each number is generated

getRankOfNumber(int x): returns the number of values less than or equal to x(not including x itslef).

Example:

Stream: 5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 9, 7, 13, 3

getRankOfNUmber(1) = 0

getRankOfNumber(3) = 1

getRankOfNumber(4) = 3

---

Solution:

Keep an sorted array can do it. The problem is we have shift all the elements after every time we need to insert an element.

We want something keeps relative order and quick at updating too.
