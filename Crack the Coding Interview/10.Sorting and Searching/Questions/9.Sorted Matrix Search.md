# Sorted Matrix Search

Given an M * N matrix in which each row and each column is sorted in ascending order, write a method to find an element.



--- 

Solution 1:

We can do a naive approach, do a binary search on each row, since there are M rows and takes O(logN) time to search each one. to it will take O(MlogN) time.

---

Solution 2:

[15, 20, 40, 85]
[20, 35, 80, 95]
[30, 55, 95, 105]
[40, 80, 100, 120]

To find 55. 

Columns:

+ if the start of column > x, then x is to the left of the column.
+ if the end of column < x, then x is to the right of the column.

Rows:

+ if the start of row > x, then x is above that row.
+ if the end of the row < x, then x is below that row. 

0. compare 55 to array[0][c-1], array[0][3], where c is the number of columns, the first element in the last column. We know x must be in columns 0, 1, 2
1. compare 55 to array[0][2] = 40, then we know x is below that row.

[20, 35, 80]
[30, 55, 95]
[40, 80, 100]

```java
public boolean findElement(int[][] matrix, int elem) {
    int row = 0;
    int col = matrix[0].length - 1;

    while (row < matrix.length && col >= 0) {
        if      (matrix[row][col] == elem) return true;
        else if (matrix[row][col] > elem) col--;
        else                              row++;
    }
}
