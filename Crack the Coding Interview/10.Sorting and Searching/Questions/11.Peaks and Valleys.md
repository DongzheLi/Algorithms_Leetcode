# Peaks and Valleys

In an array of integers, a "peak" is an element which is greater than or equal to the adjacent integers and a "valley" is an element which is less than or equal to the adjacent integers.

Example:

{5, 8, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6}

5 is a valley, 8 is a peak, 2 is a valley, 6 is a peak.

Given an array of integers, sort the array into an alternating sequence of peaks and valleys.

Example:

{5, 3, 1, 2, 3}

{5, 1, 3, 2, 3}

Solution:

{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

{2, 1, 4, 3, 5}

{1, 3, 5, 7}

{3, 1, 7, 5}

If we sort an array, then we flip in pairs, 0 and 1, 2 and 3, and so on.

---

Algorithm:

1. sort the array.
2. from index 1, swap 1 and 0, then jump to 3, swap 3 and 2, ...

```java
public void sortValleyPeak(int[] array) {
    Arrays.sort(array);
    for (int i = 1; i < array.length; i+=2) {
        swap(array, i - 1, i);
    }
}

private void swap(int[] array, int left, int right) {
    int temp = array[left];
    array[left] = array[right];
    array[right] = temp;
}
```
