# Sorted Search, No size

You are given an array-like data structure Listy which lacks a size method.

It has a elementAt(i) returns the element at index i in O(1) time.

it returns -1, it it is out of bounds.

Given a sorted Listy, find the index at which an element x occurs.

if x occurs multiple times, you may return any index.

My thoughts:

I think of binary search, but binary needs size(), so we can go to middle.

How could we compute the size??

We know if values is big enough, it will return -1.

Let's try exponential.

1, 2, 4, 8, 16,... until it returns a -1, 

if the array has length n, then we can find it in O(logn).

Solution:

```java
/* @list, the list we are searching in
 * @value, int, the value we are searching for
 */
public int search(Listy list, int value) {
    int index = 1;
    // if list.element(index) == -1, then we are out of bounds, we can search from 0 to index.
    // or we find list.elementAt(index) > value, then value must appear between 0 to index.
    while (list.elementAt(index) != -1 && list.elementAt(index) < value) {
        index *= 2;
    }
    // the value at index/2 is smaller than value, this is the only interval we need to search in.
    return binarySearch(list, value, index/2, index);
}

private int binarySearch(Listy list, int value, int low, int hight) {
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (middle > value || mid == -1) {
            high = mid - 1;
        } else if (middle < value) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            return mid;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```
