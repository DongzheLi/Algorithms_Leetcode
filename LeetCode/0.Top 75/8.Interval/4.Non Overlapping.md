# Non overlapping Intervals

Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Same as Merge Intervals, 

```java
public int eraseOverlapping(Interval[] intervals) {
    Arrays.sort(intervals, new Comparator<Interval>() {
        @Override
        public int compare(Interval a, Interval b) {
            return a.end - b.end;
        }
    })

    int end = intervals[0].end;
    int count = 1;              // number of intervals that are non-overlapping

    for (Interval i : intervals) {
        if (i.start >= end) {   // if next.start >= prev.end, then these two don't overlap
            end = i.end;
            count++;
        }
    }
    return intervals.length - count;
}
