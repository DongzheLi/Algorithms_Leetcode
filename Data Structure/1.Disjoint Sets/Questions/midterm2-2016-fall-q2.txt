Draw a valid WeightedQuickUnionUF tree with worst case height, given sizes of N=1, N=2, N=4,
N= 6, and N=8 in the boxes below, where N is the number of items in the
WeightedQuickUnionUF. The first two are done for you. Recall that the height of a tree is the
length of the longest path from the root to any leaf, so the height of the tree for N=2 is 1.

N = 1

0

N = 2

0
1

Note: The key is, worst case happens when you union two equal weight sets, both of size N/2

N = 4

        0
       1 2
         3

N = 6       height = 2

        0
      1 2 3
         4 5

N = 8       height = 3
        0
     1 2   4
       3  5  6
             7


b) best case and worst case for WeightedQuickUnion tree
worst case: theta(log(n))

best case: theta(1)

                            0
                 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 .......
